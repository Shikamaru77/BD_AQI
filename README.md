# Bangladesh AQI Prediction

## Introduction

The 'Bangladesh AQI Prediction' is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) in various regions of Bangladesh. Air pollution is a significant environmental issue that affects public health and well-being. By accurately predicting the AQI, we can raise awareness about air quality and enable citizens and policymakers to take informed actions to improve air quality.

## Motivation

The motivation behind creating this project is to address the growing concern of air pollution in Bangladesh. With rapid urbanization, industrialization, and increasing vehicular traffic, air quality has become a critical issue in many regions of the country. The project's goal is to provide an AI-based solution that can forecast AQI levels and help individuals and authorities make informed decisions to mitigate air pollution and its adverse effects on health.

## Data Collection

The project uses historical air quality data from various monitoring stations across Bangladesh. The data includes features such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) levels, along with meteorological factors like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The data is collected from reliable sources to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the data into the Machine Learning model, extensive data preprocessing is performed. This involves handling missing values, dealing with outliers, feature scaling, and data normalization. The data is also split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Development

The project utilizes various regression algorithms, including Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting Regression, to build the prediction models. Each model is trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Model Selection

The model with the best performance is selected based on evaluation metrics and is used for predicting the AQI values for unseen data.

## Web Application

The project includes a web application that allows users to input relevant features such as weather conditions and pollutant levels to get real-time AQI predictions for their region. The web application provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for easy access to AQI information.

## Importance

The 'Bangladesh AQI Prediction' project holds significant importance as it contributes to environmental sustainability and public health. By providing accurate AQI predictions, it empowers individuals to make informed decisions about outdoor activities, particularly those with health issues that may be sensitive to air pollution. It also assists authorities in implementing effective policies to reduce air pollution and create a healthier environment for all citizens.

## Conclusion

The 'Bangladesh AQI Prediction' project is a step towards leveraging the power of Machine Learning and AI to address pressing environmental challenges. By providing real-time AQI predictions and raising awareness about air quality, the project aims to promote a cleaner and healthier Bangladesh for the present and future generations.
